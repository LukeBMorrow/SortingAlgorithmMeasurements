1.Yes it was, the z-test between insertion sort and quick sort was hovering around 3, which is above the 2.5
	needed to be statistically significant.	This is likely due to its method of sorting many, smaller arrays,
	instead of one large array, and comparing far fewer items. Resulting in its O(nlogn) over insertion sorts
	O(n^2).
2.No, the z-test score was less than 1 and greater than -1, meaning that the difference in speed between quick
 	and hybrid quick sort may have been caused by random fluctuations and are not statistically significant.
